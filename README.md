### poggers school projects and side things

Hello, I'm currently an undergrad student majoring in Computer Engineering at University of Delaware :)

- working on mainly school projects right now, will most likely pick up side projects during break!
- currently learning Python 3, might learn C or C++ eventually
- looking to eventually code a progrm that allows you to install music onto and iPhone
  from your PC :)
